## How it works

The Minibyte CPU is a simple "toy" 8-bit CPU that uses a custom RISC instruction set

The CPU also has some built in DFT (Design For Test) features and a Demo ROM that can be enabled for easy testing

This was created mostly as a learning/reference project to get more familiar with Verilog

At some point between tapeout and silicon arriving, I intend to write a rudimentary assembler for creating programs that can be burned to EPROM/EEPROMs to be used with the CPU. Please monitor the main github repo for this project for eventual details.

    ou_out[6:0] - ADDR OUT BUSS

### Architecture

The Minibyte CPU uses a very traditional register architecture where most data is manipulated via a single accumulator (A Register)

The ALU operates on data from the A Register and either direct data from memory (indexed by the M register), or immediate data from the current instruction's operand (indexed by the PC register)

![Minibyte Block Diagram](block_diagram.png)

*Note that DFT and testing features are not represented in the above block diagram

### Power Up State

Upon reset, the device will be initialized with all registers cleared out to 0. This included the program counter (PC register). It is expected that the program memory will start at address 0x00 to begin execution.

### Instruction Set

The Minibyte CPU has 4 format types for its instructions. The instruction memory is chunked into bytes, with some instructions only occupying a single byte, while others consume 2 bytes for an opcode and a following operand

| Type               | Length      | Desc |
| ------------------ | -------     | ------- |
| Inherent           | 8 - bits    | IR with no operand |
| Immediate          | 16 - bits   | IR with an operand containing DATA |
| Direct             | 16 - bits   | IR with an operand containing an ADDRESS |
| Indirect           | 16 - bits   | IR with an operand containing an ADDRESS that points to another ADDRESS |

As a visual reference, here is how we would expect a basic program to look in memory. Please note that all programs start executing from address 0x00 as shown.

![Example Program Memory](program_layout.png)

This program adds the numbers 0x05 and 0x03 together, and then loops back to the starting IP of 0x00

#### Inherent IR:

| Type                  | OP[7:0]   |
| --------------------- | -------   |
| Inherent              | IR OPCODE |

#### Immediate/Direct IR:

| Type               | OP[15:8]  | OP[7:0]          |
| ------------------ | -------   | -------          |
| Immediate          | IR OPCODE | OPERAND DATA     |
| Direct             | IR OPCODE | OPERAND ADDRESS  |
| Indirect           | IR OPCODE | OPERAND ADDRESS  |

### DFT and Extra Features

The Minibyte CPU has a few DFT features that should prove helpful on live silicon debug/testing. All functions are enabled by an active high signal, so ui_in[7:0] should be tied to zero during normal operation

| ui_in Bit   | Feature                         |
| ---------   | -------                         |
| ui_in [7]   | Enable Gen Purpose Registers    |
| ui_in [6:5] | Unused                          |
| ui_in [4]   | Enable Demo ROM                 |
| ui_in [3]   | Halt Control Unit on Next Fetch |
| ui_in [2:0] | Debug Out Select                |

#### Gen Purpose Registers
The Gen Purpose Registers are a set of 8 memory mapped general purpose registers that can be accessed at the following addresses as long as ui_in [7] is tied high

| Reg Name    | Mem Address |
| ---------   | -------     |
| Register R0 | 0x78        |
| Register R1 | 0x79        |
| Register R2 | 0x7A        |
| Register R3 | 0x7B        |
| Register R4 | 0x7C        |
| Register R5 | 0x7D        |
| Register R6 | 0x7E        |
| Register R7 | 0x7F        |

#### Debug Out Select
The CPU has an extra mux between the normal addr out mux and the uo_out pins. To leverage this ui_in [2:0] can be used to select a debug signal to output on the uo_out[6:0] pins.

| Debug Out Select    | Function                            |
| ---------           | -------                             |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b000  | Normal Operation                    |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b001  | Output A[6:0] to uo_out[6:0]        |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b010  | Output A[7] to uo_out[0]            |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b011  | Output M[6:0] to uo_out[6:0]        |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b011  | Output PC[6:0] to uo_out[6:0]       |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b011  | Output IR[6:0] to uo_out[6:0]       |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b011  | Output CCR[1:0] to uo_out[1:0]      |
| ui_in[2:0] = 0b011  | Output CU_STATE[6:0] to uo_out[6:0] |


## How to test

### Simulation

The Minibyte CPU has fairly exhaustive cocotb test suite that is able to test and verify most of the device's intended functionality.

To run the test suite, cd into the ./test directory of the project and run "make"

![Simulation Results](sim_results.png)


### On Live Silicon

The easiest way to test the Minibyte CPU on live silicon is to use the built-in Demo ROM

To enable the Demo ROM, make sure that ui_in[4] and ui_in[7] are held high on reset, and remains high while the program runs

Holding ui_in[4] will enable the Demo Rom and holding ui_in[7] high will enable the General Purpose Registers


The Demo ROM will run the following program

    PSEUDOCODE:
        WHILE FOREVER{
            //Part 1: Binary Count
            SET A to 0

            WHILE A <= 255 {
                INCREMENT A

                WRITE A to ADDRESS 0x40
            }

            //Part 2: Walking 1
            SET A to 1

            WHILE A > 0 {
                LEFT SHIFT A by 1

                WRITE A to ADDRESS 0x40
            }

            //Part 3: Deadbeef to RAM/Gen Purpose Registers and back out
            LOAD 0xDEADBEEF into R0->R3

            WRITE R0 to ADDRESS 0x40
            WRITE R1 to ADDRESS 0x40
            WRITE R2 to ADDRESS 0x40
            WRITE R3 to ADDRESS 0x40
        }


To capture the output of the program with LEDs, it is recommended to add a D-Flip Flop (such as a 74x273 series chip) on the output of the data buss (uio[7:0]). See External Hardware section below for more details

## External hardware

### Demo Setup
![Demo Schematic](demo_setup.png)

Something like the above schematic is recommended to run the Demo ROM. Note that we should use an inverter (like a 74x04 series chip) as shown on the CLK of the DFF, as we want data to be latched when WE falls back to 0 (after the data has had time to set up and make its way out of the chip). Please also note that you will probably need to run the CPU at a fairly low CLK frequency in order to see any LED activity with the naked eye.

### Other Setups

The sky is the limit as far as as what devices you attach to the CPU. If you are writing your own programs, you probably are going to want to attach some sort of external ROM to the main address and data buss. Here is a recommended setup to add an external EEPROM to the demo setup so that you can test your own programs.

![External EEPROM Schematic](external_rom.png)

Beyond this, you will hopefully find that the Minibyte CPU can be paired with a wide variety 3.3V compatible parallel ROM/EPROM/EEPROM, SRAM, and IO expander modules.
